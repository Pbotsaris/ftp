# My FTP

write a description of the app here.

### File structure

For now, I separated the file structure between `client` and `server`. The client side is only here for testing as we still have a barebones of a server
that CANNOT yet handle a proper FTP connection. 

After the server is properly implemented the client implementation will go away and we will use any FTP client out there to connect.

### Server class
For now we have a simple implementation that handles a single request. I already wrapped up the socket code in a class `src/server/server.cpp`.
the header can be found in `include/server.h`.

### Compiling and running current implementation

Compile

     make

The `Makefile` will produce 2 binaries â€“ `bin/ftp`(server) and `bin/ftp_client`. First run the server

      ./bin/ftp

The server will hang waiting for a connection. Now, open another shell window and run the client

      ./bin/ftp_client

You should see the exchange of messages between the client and server in your terminal


      Hello from server!
      Received!

## Next Steps

1. Implement a loop for the server so it can handle a multple connections. The loop should run through the whole connection lifecycle - `listen`, `accept` ,`recv` and `send`
on every connection request.

2. Build a server that handles 2 connections. FTP server establish 2 connections (where HTTP only a single connection) on TCP ports `20` and `21`. One connection is for the data while the second is 
  the control connection.

3. Understand the FTP protocol so we can can build a server around that standard.

## Datatypes
While transfering data, the FTP supports a few datatypes. Some of them are undated and will not be mentioned here. The revelevant ones are as follows

**ASCII (TYPE A)**: Used for text.  This type has optional formats that were intended for printers and not relevant to this implemtation. The program will 
use the **Non-print** only(aka`format control of N`).

**Image or Binary mode (TYPE I)** The sending machine sends each file byte by byte, and the recipient stores the bytestream as it receives it. This is our main file transfer mode.

## File transfer structure
Organizational types to be implemented is the `F` or **FILE** which is the file structure in a UNIX system. 

## Log in 
Uses the `USER` and `PASS` command for for authetication. May also provide an anonymous access.

## Data Transfers

**Stream mode (MODE S)**: Data is sent as a continuous stream, relieving FTP from doing any processing. Rather, all processing is left up to TCP. No End-of-file indicator is needed, unless the data is divided into records.

**Block mode (MODE B)**: Designed primarily for transferring record-oriented files (STRU R), although can also be used to transfer stream-oriented (STRU F) text files. FTP puts each record (or line) of data into several blocks (block header, byte count, and data field) and then passes it on to TCP.[8]

**Compressed mode (MODE C)**: Extends MODE B with data compression using run-length encoding.

Most contemporary FTP clients and servers do not implement MODE B or MODE C.

### Stream mode

         In a record structured file EOR and EOF will each be indicated
         by a two-byte control code.  The first byte of the control code
         will be all ones, the escape character.  The second byte will
         have the low order bit on and zeros elsewhere for EOR and the
         second low order bit on for EOF; that is, the byte will have
         value 1 for EOR and value 2 for EOF.  EOR and EOF may be
         indicated together on the last byte transmitted by turning both
         low order bits on (i.e., the value 3).  If a byte of all ones
         was intended to be sent as data, it should be repeated in the
         second byte of the control code.
